Revision history for Perl extension Config::IniFiles.

0.01  Mon Jun 12, 2000 by RBOW
Some general code cleanup, in preparation for changes to
come. Put up Majordomo mailing list and sent invitation to
various people to join it.

0.02 Tue Jun 13, 2000 by RBOW
* Fixed bug reported by Bernie Cosell - Sections, Parameters, 
and GroupMembers return undef if there are no sections,
parameters, or group members. These functions now return
() if the particular value is undefined.
* Added some contributed documentation, from Alex Satrapa, explaining
how the internal data structure works. 
* Set up a project on SourceForge. (Not a change, but worth
noting).
* Added Groups method to return a list of section groups.

0.03 Thu Jun 15, 2000 by RBOW
* Modifications to permit 'use strict', and to get 'make test' working
again.

* Fixed bug in multiline/single line output
* Fixed bug in default handling with tie interface
* Added bugs to test.pl for regression

0.05 Sun Jun 18, 2000 by RBOW

* test.pl: Fixed some tests which use $\, and made those that try
  to check a non existant val check against ! defined.

* IniFiles.pm: hopefully fixed use of $\ when this is unset
  (problems found when running tests with -w).  Similar problem with
  $/ which can be undefined and trying to return a val which does
  not exist. Modified val docs section to indicate a undef return
  when this occurs.

To do:
* Replace IniConf.pm with a note explaining that it is now
called Config::IniFiles, and why this move was made.

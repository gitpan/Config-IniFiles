come. Put up Majordomo mailing list and sent invitation to
various people to join it.

* Fixed bug reported by Bernie Cosell - Sections, Parameters, 
and GroupMembers return undef if there are no sections,
parameters, or group members. These functions now return
() if the particular value is undefined.
* Added some contributed documentation, from Alex Satrapa, explaining
how the internal data structure works. 
* Set up a project on SourceForge. (Not a change, but worth
noting).
* Added Groups method to return a list of section groups.

0.08
2000-07-30  Adrian Phillips  <adrianp@powertech.no>
 
* test.pl: Fixed some tests which use $\, and made those that try
  to check a non existant val check against ! defined.

* IniFiles.pm: hopefully fixed use of $\ when this is unset
  (problems found when running tests with -w).  Similar problem with
  $/ which can be undefined and trying to return a val which does
  not exist. Modified val docs section to indicate a undef return
  when this occurs.
